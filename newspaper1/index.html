      In spite of crippling server issues and gruesome discoveries, Pokémon Go has soared to the top of app charts, added billions to the market value of Nintendo, and sold millions of dollars of Pokéballs and other virtual goods, as people engage in nostalgia for the original Pokémon games and discover the joys of playing games in public.

        The game is deceptively complex. At first, it seems like all you do is wander around, catching random fake animals. But unlike many mobile games, Pokémon Go leaves most of its complexity unexplained. Much like in life itself, you are dropped into a world that you must master at the same time as you figure out how it works.

      <p>
        A man and a woman have been held-up by masked gunman while playing Pokemon Go at a skate park in Sydney's south-west.

The pair, both aged 29, drove to the park on Thirlmere Way at Tahmoor at 7pm on Wednesday while playing the mobile app when a white Toyota Hilux reversed across their path, blocking them in the car park.

          Yes! The game exploded stateside on July 6, rolling out to Android users slightly before players on iOS got to check it out.

No. Apologies to our northern neighbors. Our hearts are with you.
